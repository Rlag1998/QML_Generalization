Generalization Performance of Quantum Metric Learning Classifiers

_Authors: Jonathan Kim and Stefan Bekiranov_

This code demonstrates the generalization performance of quantum metric learning ('quantum embedding') classifiers.

The resulting models attempt to classify breast cancer data and ant/bee image data.

The breast cancer data comes from the UCI ML Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset and each sample can be classified as either 'benign' or 'malignant'.
The ant/bee image data comes from the ImageNet Hymenoptera dataset and each image can be classified as either 'ant' or 'bee'.
